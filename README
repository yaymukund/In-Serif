README - In Serif
====== = == ====

Hello there,

In Serif is an application that creates and maintains stylized text files. Out
of the box, it can:

* Register users via http://url.com/register
* Add documents via http://url.com/upload
* Access documents via http://url.com/<id>, a pretty short URL!
* Edit documents via http://url.com/edit/<id>
* Browse your documents via http://www.url.com/browse/
* Create private documents that only you can see.

For those of you interested in the source, all the custom code is in apps/

/apps/core -- This pulls everything together using a simple urls.py, that
              combines django-registration and django

/apps/text -- The text app contains the bulk of the application, including the
              Document() model and views to create, edit, and view documents.

/env/ -- A virtualenv that makes the installation portable. This isn't checked
         in to the SVN, so you might have to generate it yourself. See:
            http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2009/05/
                notes-using-pip-and-virtualenv-django/

/REQUIREMENTS -- Contains the pip freeze file, with python module requirements
                 for the application. Install using pip -E env -r REQUIREMENTS.

TODO:
====

- Make apps/text/ truly portable and add a useful interface for future
  developers.

- Add JQuery to speed up the interface and tweak the font/spacing easily.
  Maybe add sliders. Everybody likes sliders.
